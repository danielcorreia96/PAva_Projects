Casos de Teste

Type A - no Before/After methods, no recursion
1. Single argument
2. Two arguments
3. Three arguments
    a) Void return Type - done
    b) String return Type - done
    c) Integer return Type - done
    d) Object return Type - done
    e) Object[] return Type
    f) List return Type
    g) ArrayList return Type


Type B - has before/after methods, no recursion
1. 1 Before method - done
2. 2 After method - done
3. 1 BM + 1 AM - done
4. 2 BM + 2 AM - done
5. Same method Before+After - done


Type C - has recursion, may have before/after
1. recursion within GF class/interface - done
infinite loop? -> 2. before method causes recursion to a primary method
infinite loop? -> 3. after method causes recursion to a primary method
4. A GF class calls another non-related GF class method - have test, didn't run it
5. A non-GF (not main app) class calls a GF class method - have test, didn't run it
6. A non-GF subclass calls method of GF superclass - have test, didn't run it
7. A non-GF superclass calls method of GF subclass - have test, didn't run it
8. A GF subclass calls method of GF superclass - have test, didn't run it
9. A GF superclass calls method of GF subclass - have test, didn't run it

Type D - misc
1. Main app uses multiple GF classes - C8 does this
2. Before and After method applicable list order - done
3. No primary method available - done
